# Password Generator Application - README

## Introduction

Welcome to the **JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator**! In this coding assignment, we created an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on their specified criteria. The application will operate within a web browser, utilizing dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by carefully crafted JavaScript code. The result is a user-friendly, responsive interface that caters to various screen sizes.
